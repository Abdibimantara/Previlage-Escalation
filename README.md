# Previlage-Escalation
When an attacker attacks a Windows Operating System most of the time they will get a base
shell or meterpreter session. This shell is limited in the actions it can perform. So, to elevate
privileges, we need to enumerate different files, directories, permissions, logs and SAM files.
The number of files inside a Windows OS is very overwhelming. Hence, doing this task
manually is very difficult even when you know where to look. So, why not automate this task
using scripts.
When an attacker attacks a Linux Operating System most of the time they will get a base shell
which can be converted into a TTY shell or meterpreter session. This shell is limited in the
actions it can perform. So, to elevate privileges, we need to enumerate different files,
directories, permissions, logs and /etc/passwd files. The number of files inside any Linux
System is very overwhelming. Hence, doing this task manually is very difficult even when you
know where to look. So, why not automate this task using scripts.
Privilege escalation is a phase that comes after the attacker has compromised the victimâ€™s
machine where he tries to gather critical information related to systems such as hidden
password and weak configured services or applications, etc. All this information helps the
attacker to make the post exploit against the machine for getting the higher-privileged shell.
In this article, we will shed light on some of the automated scripts that can be used to perform
Post Exploitation and Enumeration after getting initial accesses to Windows OS based Devices
and Linux Based Devices.
